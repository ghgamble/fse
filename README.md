To adjust the README file so the font size is consistent, you can modify the Markdown or plain text structure to avoid mixed styles. Here's a version where all sections are formatted with the same font size:

Description of file structure:

You asked for a full-site editing template (.html file) that includes a string capable of being translated with a language plugin (e.g., WPML or Polylang). Here’s how I’ve implemented this:

block-templates/single.html
This file serves as the template for displaying individual posts in the FSE environment. I included a translatable string by following WordPress translation best practices:
Translation-Ready Content: The text in the <h1> and <p> tags can be easily detected and translated by plugins like WPML and Polylang.
Dynamic Elements: The template is enhanced with placeholder content and can be customized further.
block-template-parts/footer.html
This file demonstrates how to create a reusable footer template for FSE themes. To meet your request for dynamic functionality without PHP, I used JavaScript to generate the current year dynamically:
Dynamic Year: The <script> dynamically displays the current year in the browser.
Reusable Template: This block can be included in any template using the wp:template-part block.
How Translation Plugins Work with This Code
For strings like "Welcome to My Custom Theme!" and "Contact Us," plugins such as WPML or Polylang can scan the template files and provide translation interfaces. Since the strings are plain text within block HTML, they adhere to WordPress best practices for translation.
